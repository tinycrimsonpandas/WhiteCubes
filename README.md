# WhiteCube

A (hopefully) easy way to produce a simple static gallery site for visual artists.

Built on flask, frozen flask, netlify cms, and easily deployable to Netlify's CI/CD platform for static sites. For most people, using this software you should be able to create a simple porfolio site for only the yearly cost of a custom domain name.

## Benefits
* Super simple website generator for visual artists, deploy to netlify and then use the CMS interface to add galleries, pages, and even contact forms. 
    * Can be used without Netlify on any host capable of delivering HTML documents. Though the setup for the CMS control panel requires a couple extra steps
* Responsive and mobile ready
* Integrates OpenGraph and SEO tags

## Installation

### Easiest Method

Deploy in one click to Netlify's platform!
